Overview
This lab introduces students to the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), a critical protocol for inter-domain routing on the internet. Using Cisco IOL (IOS on Linux) images in a Containerlab environment, students will configure a multi-router topology to explore external BGP (eBGP), internal BGP (iBGP), and key BGP concepts like the next-hop-self attribute. The lab includes a troubleshooting challenge to reinforce learning and a network automation task using FastAPI and NAPALM to retrieve BGP neighbor information, showcasing modern networking practices. The lab is designed to be engaging, practical, and a perfect showcase for your advertising purposes.
